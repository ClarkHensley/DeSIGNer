# Context

CSE 4533 Game Design Game Jam Game

Theme: Signs

# Initial Idea:

I wanted to make a game that I would enjoy. Thus, the goal is to make something based on logic and abstract concepts, rather than quick thinking and physical coordination.

So, my first idea: move shapes of different sizes and colors into their correct "Homes."

Each shape would have multiple qualities (shape, fill color, border color, symbol written on it, etc), and would need to move along a path to be sorted.

Signs at intersections in the path would contain 2 rules, and shapes would move based on these rules.

The goal is to filter shapes into the proper channel so that they reach their "Home."

# Update #1:

This is somewhat akin to a tower defense game, but I don't want to add a time limit. What do we do to make the shapes have to interact with the world?
