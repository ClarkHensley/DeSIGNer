# To-Do

## Context:

Normally, I would use github issues for this, but for documentation of the design process, I will instead keep this going

I began working on this on Friday, March 25th.

## March 25th:

 :white_check_mark: Generate N random shapes <br>
 :white_check_mark: Create the binary tree paths <br>
 - Create signs
 - Hover text for shapes, homes, signs

## March 26th:

 :white_check_mark: How to ensure that N random shapes have shared characteristics and the homes can be coordinated around them <br>
    :white_check_mark: Oooh! Idea: Only generate each a subset of the characteristics each time. That should work! <br>

 :white_check_mark: Fix duplicate Homes <br>
 :white_check_mark: Add home capacities <br>
 - Win/Lose
 - Title Screen
 - Instructions
 - Music
 - Movement <br>
 :white_check_mark: Idle Animations <br>
 - DeSIGNer
