# To-Do

## Context:

Normally, I would use github issues for this, but for documentation of the design process, I will instead keep this going

I began working on this on Friday, March 25th.

## March 25th:

[  ]  Generate N random shapes
[  ]  Create the binary tree paths
[  ]  Create signs
[  ]  Hover text for shapes, homes, signs
